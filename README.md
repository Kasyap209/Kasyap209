Hi, I am Kasyap Suresh. I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) where I specialized in Wireless Networking for passive IoT devices. I was advised by Dr. Varun Jeoti and Dr. Micheal Drieberg. I worked on different problems such as developing a generalized approach for simultaneously reading numerous Radio Frequency ID tags (of any type) at the same time, improving read range for Ultra-Wideband SAW tags, and an efficient low-cost detection and navigation technique for autonomous driving. I have had an internship experience with UTP where I worked on developing radio receiver systems based on GNU Radio platforms and SDR.

Skills:
- Extensive knowledge of communication systems, wireless and computer networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Machine Learning.
- Familiar with 3GPP standardization for 3G/LTE/5G NR across Physical layer.
- Deep knowledge of TDMA/FDMA/CDMA/OCDMA/WCDMA/SDMA radio access techniques for various real-time applications and 2G/3G architectures.
- Implementation experience in MATLAB system level simulator with respect to designing efficient SAW radio ID tags.
- In-depth knowledge of 5G NR and massive MIMO, especially PHY layer.
- Software skills: C, C++, MATLAB, Octave, and Python 3.
